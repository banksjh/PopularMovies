# PopularMovies
Popular Movies was developed as part of the [Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801) program.

### TheMovieDb API key is required

To download the movie data, Popular Movies requires an API key from themoviedb.org. This key must be included for a successful build.

You can obtain a key from the [TheMovieDb website](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Once you have an API key, you must add it to the [App Home]/gradle.properties with the following line:

'MyMovieDbKey="<API_KEY>"'
